### Project Overview

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. One main operational challenge is the redistribution logistics of bikes to maintain availability across the city. Solving this issue would allow rental bikes to be available to the public at the right time, lessening their waiting time. The following questions will be answered, which will provide impactful insights and recommendations for this problem.

### Data Sources

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "SeoulBikeData.csv" file, containing detailed information about weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

### Tools

Python (Data preprocessing, Data Analysis, Data Visualisation)

### Data Cleaning

1. Data Loading/Inspection
2. Data Cleaning and formatting
3. Added features for analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. How does bike rental demand vary throughout the day?
2. How does bike rental demand vary with Season, Holiday, Functioning Day, etc?
3. Does bike rental demand have any correlation with any other numerical features?
